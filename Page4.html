				<h5>Law of Common Fate</h5>
				<p> The Law of Common Fate dictates that people tend to group objects with the same direction of movement 
				as a collective unit. This principle presumes that as soon as the movement is apparent to the viewer, the 
				relationship between objects start to develop.
				<br><span style="color:#795548">blank line</span><br>
				This is used to establish connections in software interfaces. A good example is a drop-down menu, as seen 
				in the image on the right, that is commonly used on almost on every website. <p>

				<p>Hierarchy in text is another visual device that suggests movement and it serves to direct the viewer's 
				attention through information in a logical way, from the largest font to the smallest. This is commonly used 
				as a visual communication device in graphic design.
				<br><span style="color:#795548">blank line</span><br>
				Directional lines are often used in photography. The photographer forces the viewers eye to follow linear 
				elements to draw attention to specific areas of the image.</p>

				<img src="images/closure.jpg" alt="common fate" />

			<div class="pg4_right grid_4 omega">
				<h5>Law of Closure</h5>
				<p>The Law of Closure says that elements are perceived as a group if they belong to a object that can be closed. 
				This principle is based on drawing conclusions from the detail 
				provided. The viewer fills in the missing pieces. This makes content more engaging and interesting.
				<br><span style="color:#795548">blank line</span><br>
				Logo design makes good use of this principle and the IBM logo is a classic example. Created from a series of 
				horizontal lines, it is perceived as a complete image.</p>
			</div>
		<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="pg4_cont alpha">
				<p>The panda in the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) logo is another example of Closure.
				<br><span style="color:#795548">blank line</span><br>
				There should be a balance between too much information and not enough. If too much information is given, 
				the viewer doesn't apply their imagination. Too little information won't give enough clues and will result in frustration.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="pg4_right grid_4 alpha">
				<h2>Law of Simplicity</h2>
				<p>This law is also referred to as the Law of Pragnanz or the Law of Good Figure. It dictates that objects are always 
				perceived in the easiest way possible. Furthermore, when the entire object is kept simple, it emphasizes the important 
				features. 
				<br><span style="color:#795548">blank line</span><br>
				The iconic design of the Apple iPod is an example of this law. Controls are kept to an absolute minimum and simply labelled.
				As a result, their apparent function is obvious to the user. Its design allows for ease of use.</p>

			<div class="mediawide grid_8 omega">
				<img src="images/simplicity.jpg" alt="common fate" />

		<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="pg4_cont alpha">
				<p>The key component of this law says to keep it simple and maintain focus on what really matters. A visual scene or object 
				is understood in the simplest and most easily recognizable way. The wheel design of the iPod control panel immediately suggests to the 
				user that it is an object to be rotated. The inclusion of the icons cements the idea that this item relates to the function of the object. 
				Furthermore, the icons are easily recognisable and presented to the user in a universal, graphical language.</p>

				<img src="images/meaningfulness.jpg" alt="common fate" />
			</div>
			<div class="pg4_right grid_4 omega">
				<h2>Law of Familiarity or Meaningfulness</h2>
				<p>This law describes the human perceptual ability to form meaningful mental representations in order to make successful 
				conversions and connections between objects in the real and designed worlds.
				<br><span style="color:#795548">blank line</span><br>
				On the left are some examples of this principle put to use in road signs. 
				The elements refer to objects in the real world and the motorist can quickly interpret their meaning while driving by.</p>
			</div>
		<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="pg4_cont alpha">
				<p>Signs in buildings, for example, fire escape routes also use this principle.
				<br><span style="color:#795548">blank line</span><br>
				Familiarity governs perceptual organisation, which describes the way people interpret certain combinations of shapes, curves and 
				lines as forming a meaningful object, figure or image. Without the capacity to turn sensory input into meaningful information, 
				we would be incapable of developing an understanding of things in our environment.</p>
