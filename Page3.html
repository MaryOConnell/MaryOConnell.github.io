		<h1>Design Inspiration For Your Website</h1>

			<h2>Sample Project : Irish Tourism Website</h2>
			<p>Deciding on an approach for a design concept is often difficult. A combination of elements, 
			such as colours, shapes and typography can make for an attractive composition. Design aspects 
			such as balance, colour and visual hierarchy should adhere to Gestalt laws. Applying these rules 
			effectively ensures that the information contained in your design is properly communicated.
			<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
			The following is a hypothetical sketch design for an Irish tourism website. Gestalt principles
			found in architecture have been applied to the container shell. While certain tasks have to be 
			completed at your desk, it's a good idea to get away from your screen. Looking to fresh sources 
			for ideas can give a unique perspective that you can work in to your design concept.</p>

				<h3>Sourcing Material</h3>
				<p>Photographs of historic buildings were sourced and used as a starting point for a sketch design.
				Modern architectural facades could work equally well. Keeping the rules of Gestalt Theory in mind, head out
				with a camera or a sketchbook and look for structures that you find appealing. Some guidelines are presented
				below:
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				Architectural and manmade structural forms are often based on a grid system which translates well into web design.
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				Elements, such as openings, are often grouped together and set out along this grid. Interpreting this idea for your 
				web design will allow you to lay out your content in a logical and organised manner.
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				Architectural features, such as arches and feature windows, are stand alone items that are given prominence and plenty of 
				breathing space. You can draw attention to an important item on your webpage by applying the same rationale.</p>

				<h3>Sketching Ideas</h3>
				<p>After gathering images of a selection of buildings that might fit your theme, review them and identify 
				elements that could translate well into your design. This can be a matter of lifting a sketch directly from the facade 
				of a building. Alternatively, you might single out common features and use them as a guide.
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				In this case, inspiration was drawn from the blocky shapes of the old castles. The wall planes are divided into projections 
				and recesses, giving emphasis to some elements and forcing others into the background. This influenced the design for the 
				slide out menu and the nav bar at the left.
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				Images were set out along a grid, reflecting the distribution of castle wall openings, and allowing for adequate white space. The 
				logo is featured in a prominent position on the page, a distance away from the rest of the information.
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				Colours and typography can be incorporated to further complement the theme. The result adheres to Gestalt laws but 
				retains an architectural identity.</p>

			<h2>Finding Inspiration</h2>
			<p>Architecture can be a good source for mining ideas for your webpage. Depending on your goals and project requirements,
			a concept can often be worked up directly from the building facade itself, as shown in the examples below. The key is to explore other design
			disciplines as resources when developing ideas.</p>
