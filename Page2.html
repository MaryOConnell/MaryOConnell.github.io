				<h2>Law of Proximity</h2>
				<p>The Law of Proximity indicates that elements that are near to each other tend to be perceived as a single unit. 
				Here, the spaces between the glazing are defined by the stone structure. We interpret the glass as a single element and the 
				walls as another, even though they are both composed of smaller units, i.e., panes of glass and blocks.
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				Grouping elements that belong together is a way of defining categories. You can easily group the components of one 
				category by placing them near each other.
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				This law is regularly used as a usability feature, for example, in the control panel of a stereo system or the dashboard 
				of a car. It is also evident in graphic design layouts, such as magazines.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="p2_cont grid_8 alpha">
				<h2>Law of Symmetry</h2>
				<p> People view symmetry as pleasing and comforting and tend to prefer symmetric appearances over asymmetric ones. 
				Symmetric objects or arrangements are associated with positive aspects such as stability, consistency and structure. 
				Asymmetric arrangements on the other hand give a rather negative impression, like something is wrong, missing, or out of balance.
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				Much architectural design is based on symmetric grid systems . This is done not only for aesthetic reasons but also for economy 
				of cost and to streamline the design process.
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				Furniture design is generally symmetric, for example, tables and wardrobes, as well as the shape of foodstuffs 
				packaging, such as egg cartons and cereal boxes.</p>

				<h2>Law of Similarity</h2>
				<p> The Law of Similarity states that items that appear similar are perceived as a single element. So elements 
				that have the same shape, colour or other common characteristics, are perceived to be belonging together. This 
				phenomenon can be very useful to group items that belong to one category.
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				An example can be seen in the buildings to the left. Our eyes are drawn to the lighted windows and we see them 
				as a single unit.
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				Software applications use similarity to group together icons and menu bar content in a logical way. This allows 
				users to more easily navigate the user interface.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="p2_cont grid_8 alpha">
				<h2>Law of Continuity</h2>
				<p>The principle of continuity dictates that once the eye begins to follow something, it will continue travelling in 
				that direction until it encounters another object.
				<br><span style="color:#fff"></span><br>
				Architecture contains many subtle and obvious clues to lead people around a structure, both visually and physically. 
				For example, decorative canopies are sometimes erected over doorways to emphasise the location of an entrance. Handrails on 
				staircases physically lead a person onto a different level of a building.
				<br><span style="color:#fff"></span><br>
				Other ways to lead the eye include a photograph or illustration that contains an image of a person. The person featured should 
				be looking toward the rest of the design or have their body facing in that direction.</p>

				<h2>Figure Ground</h2>
				<p>The Law of Figure and Ground is based on the relationship between an element and its surrounding space. It 
				describes how we more easily perceive a figure than its background. When one element is placed on top of another, 
				an impression of depth emerges.
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				This principle is also referred to as positive and negative space, the positive being the object and the negative 
				referring to the space around it. In this example, the black cladding elements appear to pop out and the 
				white cladding appears recessed. 
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				This feature is commonly used in text, even handwriting. The text is placed on a highly contrasting background, for example,
				black font on white background, for ease of legibility.</p>
