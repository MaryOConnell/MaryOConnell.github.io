		<h1>Gestalt Theory In Design</h1>
		
		<div class="homecont_intro">
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Gestalt (whole form) psychology is a theory of mind that originated in the Berlin School in the 1920s. It describes the laws 
			of acquiring and maintaining meaningful perceptions from an apparently chaotic world. The central principle is that the human 
			mind has self-organising tendencies. The viewer perceives interactions between various visual stimuli and interprets them as a 
			whole object, independent of the parts.

			Gestalt rules have been incorporated into design theory as a means to effectively communicate ideas and information between 
			the designer and the recipient. This website presents this theory with examples of how it has been applied to various types 
			of design.</p>

				<h3>Gestalt Principles In Architectural Design</h3>
				<p>The principles of Gestalt are apparent in all architectural design, both historic and modern. Ancient architecture is 
				an example of how people attempted to assign order to their world. Examination of enduring ancient structures such as 
				Mayan cities, the Roman Colosseum and Egyptian temples reveal how our ancestors interpreted and constructed their surroundings.
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				Modern architecture continues to make use of these Gestalt properties. Examples can be found around the world, from the smallest
				cottage to some of the world's tallest buildings.</p>

				<h3>Design Inspiration For Your Website : Sample Project</h3>
				<p>Deciding on an approach for a design concept is often difficult. A combination of elements, 
				such as colours, shapes and typography can make for an attractive composition. Design aspects 
				such as balance, colour and visual hierarchy should adhere to Gestalt laws. Applying these rules 
				effectively ensures that the information contained in your design is properly communicated.

				<h3>Examples Of Gestalt Theory In Modern Design</h3>
				<p>The principles of Gestalt are used in the context of modern visual and interactive media. However, early Gestalt theory did not anticipate 
				digital design and newer applications of visual media. The original laws still hold true in modern design. However, the early theory has been 
				expanded upon and rules have been developed further to the original principles to accommodate these applications.
				<br><span style="color:#fff">blank line</span><br>
				These examples describe some of the modern usages of Gestalt principles. They are the foundation of good design and an essential feature
				of effective visual communication.
